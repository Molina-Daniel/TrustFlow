# 🏛️ Receptor Verification Protocol (Versión Avanzada)

In **TrustFlow**, funds are only released to **verified recipients**—individuals, collectives, or organizations that meet transparency, legitimacy, and traceability criteria. This ensures that proposals generated by AI or submitted by the community are **executed responsibly** and **produce measurable impact**.

## 🧾 Multi-Layer Identity Verification

To register as a **funding recipient**, users must complete a multi-step verification process:

### 1. **Web3 Wallet Verification**

* Must connect and sign with a non-custodial wallet
* Wallet address becomes the main on-chain identity

### 2. **Talent Protocol Integration**

* Users link their [Talent Protocol](https://talentprotocol.com/) profile
* Verifies contribution history, skills, reputation and endorsements
* Adds human context and credibility to on-chain identity

### 3. **NGO / Legal Entity Registration (for Institutions)**

* Required for organizations requesting > \$1,000 equivalent in funding
* Must submit:

  * Proof of registration in their country (e.g., government ID, tax certificate)
  * Website or public presence
  * Designated contact person
* Information is reviewed by DAO governance or verified by automated oracle (TBD)

### 4. **Reputation and Execution History**

* Recipients build reputation by successfully executing past projects
* Optionally verified via Gitcoin Passport, BrightID, or other DID systems

---

## 🔒 Optional Staking Mechanism

Recipients may be required to **stake tokens** or **reputation points** as collateral:

* Prevents abuse or spam proposals
* Aligns incentives
* Enables slashing if misuse or fraud is detected

---

## 🗳️ DAO-Based Assignment

Once a proposal is created (by AI agent or user submission), eligible verified recipients can:

* Apply to execute the initiative
* Submit an implementation plan, budget, and impact estimate
* Be voted on by the DAO

Only after DAO approval and full identity verification is the funding released to the chosen executor.
