## 📘 Understanding the Impact Report Table

The **Impact Report** is a transparency tool that tracks the lifecycle of funded proposals on TrustFlow. It allows anyone to verify how much funding was raised, where it went, and what real-world results it produced.

Below is a breakdown of each column in the table:

| Column              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proposal**        | The title or name of the funded initiative. It typically includes a short, clear summary of the objective.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Category**        | The thematic area the proposal belongs to, such as *Food Security*, *Health & Wellness*, etc. This helps users filter proposals by cause.                                                                                                                            |
| **Funds Raised**    | The total amount of money (in USD equivalent) that was collected via donations or DAO allocation.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Funds Used**      | The portion of the raised funds that has been actually spent or disbursed by the recipient. A missing value may indicate that no report has been submitted yet.                                                                                                      |
| **People Impacted** | A quantitative or contextual description of the direct beneficiaries (e.g., 250 children, 120 families, a specific region).                                                                                                                                          |
| **Reported By**     | The wallet or entity that submitted the impact report. Can also display “No report” or “Just Funded” if no follow-up has been provided yet.                                                                                                                          |
| **Status**          | Current state of the proposal lifecycle. Example statuses include:  \n- ✅ **Completed** (Fully reported)  \n- 🟡 **In Progress** (Execution underway)  \n- 🔴 **Missing Report** (No proof submitted)  \n- 🔵 **Just Funded** (Recently approved, pending execution) |

## 📊 What is an Impact Report?

An **Impact Report** is a public record of what happened after a proposal received funding. It includes:

* Proof of execution (photos, receipts, on-chain confirmations)
* Description of what was done and who benefited
* Use of funds (how much was spent, on what, by whom)

These reports ensure that **TrustFlow remains transparent, credible, and community-driven**.

Impact Reports can be submitted directly on-chain or through a web interface and are linked to proposal IDs and the executor’s wallet.
