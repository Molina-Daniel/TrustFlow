## ü¶ä Wallet Setup & Test Tokens
Accessed [TrustFlow](https://trust-flow-kappa.vercel.app/) with MetaMask
I connected my MetaMask wallet to the Moonbase Alpha testnet (an EVM-compatible parachain on Kusama).

### Requested Test Tokens (WND)
To interact with contracts, I requested Polkadot test tokens (WND) via the Polkadot Faucet
These are needed to cover gas fees on Moonbase Alpha.

## Ready to Interact
With WND in my wallet, I could donate, receive governance tokens, and participate in the DAO process on TrustFlow.
