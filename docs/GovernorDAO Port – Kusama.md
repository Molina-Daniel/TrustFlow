# 📘 GovernorDAO Port – Kusama 

## ✅ What We Ported

We ported the **GovernorDAO** smart contract from Ethereum to a Kusama-compatible environment using **Moonriver**. This contract enables on-chain proposal creation, voting, and execution using a token-weighted governance model, serving as the foundation for TrustFlow’s decentralized decision-making.

## 🛠️ How We Did It

- Adapted and optimized `GovernorDAO.sol` for Moonriver’s EVM compatibility.  
- Deployed to **Moonbase Alpha** (testnet) for functional validation.  
- Successfully launched on **Moonriver (Kusama)** mainnet.  
- Verified all core functions: proposal creation, voting, and execution.  
- Extended support for:
  - **TrustFlow categories**
  - Interaction with the `FundingManager.sol` donation registry.

## 🌍 How This Improves Social Governance

Traditional philanthropy and NGO funding systems often rely on:

- Centralized boards  
- Opaque approvals  
- Delayed disbursements

**By porting GovernorDAO to Kusama and integrating it into TrustFlow, we:**

### 🔓 Open up decision-making  
Any token holder can vote—no elite trustees or private committees required.

### 📈 Make governance transparent  
All proposals, votes, and results are recorded on-chain for public verification.

### ⚡ Speed up social response  
Funding proposals are executed immediately upon approval, with no bureaucratic delays.

### 🧠 Enable data-driven participation  
AI-generated proposals guide the community toward initiatives based on real-time donation trends and impact analytics.

> ✅ In short: this port brings **democracy, transparency, and automation** to the funding of social good—at a speed and scale traditional systems can’t match.
