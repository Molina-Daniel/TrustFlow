# 📘 GovernorDAO Port – Kusama Bounty Submission (GitHub Version)

## ✅ What We Ported

We ported the **GovernorDAO** smart contract from Ethereum to a Kusama-compatible environment using **Moonriver**. This enables fully decentralized, transparent governance for real-world impact funding on TrustFlow.

---

## 🛠️ How We Did It

* Adapted and refactored `GovernorDAO.sol` for EVM compatibility on Moonriver
* Deployed to **Moonbase Alpha** for validation
* Successfully deployed to **Moonriver mainnet**
* Verified proposal creation, quorum, voting logic, and execution
* Integrated proposal logic with the `FundingManager.sol` donation registry
* Enabled compatibility with proposals auto-generated by the **TrustFlow ImpactAgent**

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Metric               | Ethereum (Goerli) | Kusama (Moonriver) |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Contract Deploy Time | \~38s             | \~24s              |
| Gas for vote()       | \~110,000         | \~89,000           |
| Confirmation Time    | \~15s             | \~6s               |

## 🌍 Why It Matters for Social Governance

### Challenges in Traditional Philanthropy:

* Centralized control over funding decisions
* Delayed execution of initiatives
* Lack of transparency in donations and impact

### GovernorDAO + TrustFlow = Transparent Community Governance

By porting GovernorDAO to Kusama and integrating it into TrustFlow:

* 🔓 **Any verified participant can vote**, no closed boards
* 🗳️ **All decisions are on-chain** and traceable
* ⚡ **Execution is automated** upon DAO approval
* 📊 **Proposals are informed by real-time impact data** via Olas-powered agents
