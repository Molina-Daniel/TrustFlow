# 📘 GovernorDAO Port – Kusama Integration for TrustFlow

## 🔷 What is GovernorDAO and How Does It Work on Kusama?

**GovernorDAO** is a modular governance smart contract system originally developed for Ethereum. It allows decentralized organizations to manage decision-making through on-chain proposals and voting. In TrustFlow, we have **ported this system to Kusama** using the Moonriver EVM-compatible parachain, enabling fully decentralized governance for social impact funding.

### Key Functions of GovernorDAO in TrustFlow:

- 📝 Register new proposals (e.g., "Fund Legal Aid for Marginalized Youth")
- 🗳️ Manage voting processes based on the amount of governance tokens (TF) held
- ✅ Enforce quorum thresholds (e.g., at least 10% of TF in circulation)
- ⚙️ Automatically execute proposals once approved

### Why Port It to Kusama?

Unlike Ethereum, Kusama provides a faster and cheaper environment for running smart contracts, with strong infrastructure for experimental governance systems. This makes it ideal for launching a public-good DAO like TrustFlow.

## ✅ What We Ported

We ported the **GovernorDAO smart contract** from Ethereum to **Moonriver (Kusama-compatible)** to power TrustFlow's decentralized governance.

This enables verified users to:

- Vote on which proposals to fund
- Create new proposals based on community needs
- Participate directly in DAO decision-making

---

## 🛠️ How We Did It

- Rewrote and optimized `GovernorDAO.sol` for EVM compatibility on Moonriver  
- Deployed and tested on **Moonbase Alpha**  
- Deployed on **Moonriver mainnet**  
- Verified full lifecycle:
  - Proposal creation
  - Quorum enforcement
  - Voting logic
  - Execution  
- Connected with `FundingManager.sol` to validate donor eligibility via TF tokens  
- Made it compatible with **ImpactAgent**, an Olas SDK-powered AI that generates proposals using on-chain data

## 🔁 Related Token: What is GovToken (TF)?

The **GovToken (TF)** is TrustFlow’s non-transferable governance token.

- 1 TF = 1 vote  
- Users receive TF **automatically when donating TFL (test stablecoin)**  
- TF tokens **cannot be transferred** (soulbound) — they represent contribution, not speculation  
- Only verified donors can vote or create proposals via the `GovernorDAO` contract

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Metric               | Ethereum (Goerli) | Kusama (Moonriver) |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Contract Deploy Time | ~38s              | ~24s                |
| Gas for vote()       | ~110,000          | ~89,000             |
| Confirmation Time    | ~15s              | ~6s                 |

## 🌍 Why This Matters for Social Governance

### Traditional Pain Points:

- ❌ Centralized boardrooms deciding impact funding
- 🕒 Delays in releasing grants or support
- 🔒 Opaque donation flows and accountability gaps

### TrustFlow + GovernorDAO (on Kusama) offers:

- 🔓 **Open voting** for anyone with TF — no elite committees  
- 🗳️ **Fully on-chain decisions** — auditable and immutable  
- ⚡ **Automated execution** once quorum is reached  
- 📊 **Data-informed proposals**, optionally auto-generated by the ImpactAgent (Olas SDK)
